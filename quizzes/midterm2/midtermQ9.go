// Develop exam2-p14-4.go such that it allows multiple clients such as your exam2-p13-4.go to connect, send “play\n”, receive a short response from your exam2-p14-4.go saying “Welcome to The Price is Right! Let’s guess the price of a 12-person tent.\n”. Afterwards, set the true price to 9053, allow the client to send a number in 1-10000 followed by “\n”, receive a short response from your exam2-p14-4.go saying the guess is “Too high\n” if the guess is higher than the true answer, “Too low\n” if the guess is lower, or “Bingo\n” if the guess is right. Then, close the connection.
